  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <div class="content-body">
    <p>Comvoy is a national marketplace for commercial work trucks, connecting dealers across the country with individual buyers and fleet managers. As the principal designer from inception in 2019 through 2025, I was responsible for establishing the visual identity, navigation structure, and user experience. The platform launched quickly by leveraging existing architecture from the company's dealer SaaS product, but that speed came with constraints — an exhaustive filter system with poor information hierarchy, cramped layouts, and a color scheme that didn't resonate with the work truck demographic.</p>

    <p>Over six years, I led incremental, data-driven improvements within those constraints: mobile optimization that improved page load scores by 65%, A/B testing that validated CTA and component changes, and strategic filter reorganization based on Google Analytics usage data. When new product leadership opened the door to comprehensive redesign, I proposed a bold, modern visual direction with a simplified card-based search experience and vehicle-first detail pages. Within five months of my departure, approximately 75% of those recommendations were implemented — validation that the design vision I'd advocated for with data over six years was the right direction all along.</p>

  <h2>Building Comvoy from the Ground Up (2019-2025)</h2>
  <div class="content-body">
    <p>Comvoy is a national marketplace for commercial work trucks connecting dealers across the country with individual buyers and fleet managers. As the principal designer from inception through 2025, I was responsible for establishing the visual identity, navigation structure, and user experience working directly with the CEO. The platform launched quickly by leveraging existing SaaS architecture for the vehicle search page (VSP) and vehicle detail page (VDP), which allowed rapid deployment but carried technical limitations and outdated UX patterns not optimized for a large national marketplace.

  <h2>The Challenge</h2>
  <div class="content-body">
    <p>The inherited architecture presented significant constraints. The VSP featured an exhaustive, poorly organized filter sidebar listing every search category with raw data rather than strategic hierarchy. Vehicle cards displayed in list style with two small images instead of a modern card layout. The VDP used a cramped three-column layout that created visual strain and buried important information. The color scheme (racing orange and teal) felt off-brand for the work truck demographic. Primary CTAs like "I'm interested" tested poorly compared to alternatives. Leadership resistance to change slowed evolution, prioritizing dealer-focused content features (dealership directory, "best in show" galleries) over buyer experience improvements, despite advocacy from both design and product teams.</p>

  <h2>Progress Witin Constraints</h2>
  <div class="content-body">
    <p>Over six years, I led incremental improvements validated through data. Working closely with product management to identify performance issues, mobile optimization efforts increased page load scores from 40% to 65% improvement in LCP and CLS metrics. Their collaboration in advocating for these technical improvements was instrumental to gaining leadership buy-in. A/B testing proved the vehicle carousel could be removed with no negative impact on conversions while improving load times. Mobile filter refinements and contextual UX features improved mobile retention by 5% (mobile represented 70% of traffic). Multivariate tests showed "Check availability" CTA performed 0.8% better than "I'm interested." Google Analytics data revealed the most frequently used search filters, which informed strategic filter reorganization. Competitive analysis of other marketplaces and ecommerce platforms provided patterns for presenting those priority filters, particularly on mobile where a minimized list showcased top-used options with "View all" for refined search.</p>

  <h2>The Proposed Redesign</h2>
  <div class="content-body">
    <p>New product leadership opened the door to comprehensive modernization. The redesign philosophy centered on vehicle-first presentation and bold, professional visual identity reflecting the work truck industry. Color scheme shifted from orange/teal to dark slate gray, black, white, and orange - grounded, modern, confident.</p>

    <p>VSP redesign proposed card-based layout (three per row on desktop) with single large vehicle image, carousel gallery, streamlined attributes, clear pricing, location, and "Check availability" CTA. Filter sidebar simplified through nested categories with overflow scrolling, reducing overall height. Mobile filters showed minimized top-used options with "View all" for refined search.</p>

    <p>VDP redesign emphasized vehicle images and attributes in a 2/3 layout with larger image gallery, refined specifications display, and reduced visual strain from the old three-column tables. Pricing, rebates, and lead form occupied the remaining third. <b>This VDP redesign has not yet been fully adopted by the current team.</b></p>

    <p>Navigation simplified the mega menu from multiple columns and ads to focused body types, popular brands, and upfit manufacturers.</p>

  <h2>Outcome</h2>
  <div class="content-body">
    <p>Approximately 75% of proposed recommendations were implemented within five months of departure, including VSP card layout, filter organization, mobile optimization, navigation simplification, and color scheme modernization. The validation of this design vision by new leadership confirmed the strategic direction advocated through data over six years. </p>

  <h2>Personal Learning</h2>
  <div class="content-body">
    <p>As the sole digital UX/UI designer across multiple company initiatives with limited development resources, strategic prioritization and data-driven advocacy were essential to move the needle on a flagship product resistant to change. Small, validated improvements compound over time.</p>
